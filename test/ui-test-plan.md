# UI test plan for MoistBot

Each case is run by `test/test-ui.ps1`, which verifies the full, exact console
transcript (including banner and dividers) and stops at the first mismatch.

## Shared output framing

Every transcript begins with the banner followed by:

```text
Good day. I am MoistBot, at your service.
How may I assist you today?
```

Each response is surrounded by the underscore divider. A successful `bye`
command ends with:

```text
Thank you for using MoistBot. Have a pleasant day.
```

## Test case 1: startup and exit

Aim: Confirm that the professional greeting and farewell are displayed.

Inputs: `bye`

Expected output: The shared greeting, followed by the shared farewell.

## Test case 2: empty list

Aim: Confirm that an empty list is described courteously.

Inputs: `list`, `bye`

Expected output:

```text
Certainly. Here is your task list:
Your task list is presently empty. You may use: bye, list, todo, deadline, event, find, mark, unmark, or delete.
```

## Test case 3: add todo and list

Aim: Confirm that adding and viewing a todo uses the courteous confirmation.

Inputs: `todo buy milk`, `list`, `bye`

Expected output:

```text
Certainly. I have added this task:
[T][ ] buy milk
Your list now contains 1 task.
Certainly. Here is your task list:
1.[T][ ] buy milk
```

## Test case 4: add deadline, event, mark, and unmark

Aim: Confirm that all successful task operations retain their behavior and use
the new tone.

Inputs: `todo read book`, `deadline return book /by 2/12/2019 1800`,
`event team meeting /from 3/12/2019 1400 /to 3/12/2019 1600`,
`mark 2`, `list`, `unmark 2`, `bye`

Expected output: Each addition begins “Certainly. I have added this task:”.
The deadline is displayed as `Dec 02 2019, 6:00 PM`, is marked complete then
incomplete, and the event is displayed from `Dec 03 2019, 2:00 PM` to
`Dec 03 2019, 4:00 PM`. The list contains all three tasks.

## Test case 5: unrecognised command

Aim: Confirm that an unknown command is declined politely without adding work.

Inputs: `buy groceries today`, `list`, `bye`

Expected output:

```text
My apologies, but I do not recognise the command 'buy'. Available commands are: bye, list, find, todo, deadline, event, mark, unmark, and delete.
```

The following list remains empty as in test case 2.

## Test case 6: malformed additions

Aim: Confirm that malformed todo, deadline, and event commands provide polite,
actionable corrections and do not add tasks. Invalid calendar dates, times,
unsupported date text, inconsistent event endpoint precision, and backwards
event ranges are also rejected without changing the task list.

Inputs: the malformed command sequence in `test/test-ui.ps1` test case 6,
followed by valid deadline and event commands, `list`, and `bye`.

Expected output: Missing fields begin with “Please provide” or “Please
include”; duplicate separators explain that only one is allowed. Invalid date
values explain the accepted formats. The final list contains only `revise
notes`, displayed with `Oct 15 2019`, and the date-only `lab` event running
from `Oct 16 2019` to `Oct 17 2019`.

## Test case 7: invalid mark and unmark

Aim: Confirm that invalid task numbers are declined politely and do not change
the completion state.

Inputs: the invalid index sequence in `test/test-ui.ps1` test case 7.

Expected output: The empty-list, non-numeric, out-of-range, and malformed
arguments explain the correction. Only `mark 1` and `unmark 1` change the
status of `read book`.

## Test case 8: blank input

Aim: Confirm that a blank command is handled politely and the program remains
available.

Inputs: blank line, `bye`

Expected output:

```text
Please enter a command, such as 'list' or 'todo buy milk'.
```

## Test case 9: list date validation and argument-free commands

Aim: Confirm that `list` rejects an invalid date and `bye` rejects extra text
politely.

Inputs: `list now`, `bye now`, `list`, `bye`

Expected output:

```text
Please enter a valid list date as yyyy-MM-dd or d/M/yyyy, for example 'list 2019-12-03'.
The 'bye' command does not accept arguments. Please enter only 'bye'.
```

The app then prints the empty list and continues to the farewell.

## Test case 10: delete a task

Aim: Confirm that deleting task 2 removes the correct task, reports the deleted
task and updated count, and renumbers the remaining tasks.

Inputs: `todo first task`, `todo second task`, `todo third task`, `delete 2`,
`list`, `bye`.

Expected output:

```text
Certainly. I have deleted this task:
[T][ ] second task
Your list now contains 2 tasks.
Certainly. Here is your task list:
1.[T][ ] first task
2.[T][ ] third task
```

## Test case 11: invalid delete

Aim: Confirm that missing, non-numeric, zero, out-of-range, overflowed, and
malformed delete numbers are explained politely without changing the list.

Inputs: the invalid delete sequence in `test/test-ui.ps1` test case 11.

Expected output: Each invalid command explains the correction and next action.
The final list still contains the unchanged `read book` task.

## Test case 12: task changes are saved to disk

Aim: Confirm that additions, completion-status changes, and deletions rewrite the saved
task list using a stable representation. This is verified as the closest
automated check because saving does not add console output.

Inputs: `todo read book`, `deadline return book /by 2/12/2019 1800`,
`event meeting /from 3/12/2019 1400 /to 3/12/2019 1600`,
`todo compare A | B`, `mark 2`, `delete 1`,
`bye`

Expected file at `data/moistbot.txt`:

```text
D | 1 | return book | 2019-12-02 1800
E | 0 | meeting | 2019-12-03 1400 | 2019-12-03 1600
T | 0 | compare A \| B
```

Expected console output: The existing successful add, mark, and delete
confirmations, followed by the shared farewell. Saving produces no additional
console output.

## Test case 13: saved tasks are loaded at startup

Aim: Confirm that MoistBot restores todo, deadline, and event tasks together
with their completion states before accepting the first command.

Initial file at `data/moistbot.txt` (with an optional UTF-8 byte-order mark):

```text
T | 1 | read book
D | 0 | return book | 2019-12-02 1800
E | 0 | meeting | 2019-12-03 1400 | 2019-12-03 1600
T | 0 | review A \| B \\ notes
```

Inputs: `list`, `bye`

Expected output:

```text
Certainly. Here is your task list:
1.[T][X] read book
2.[D][ ] return book (by: Dec 02 2019, 6:00 PM)
3.[E][ ] meeting (from: Dec 03 2019, 2:00 PM to: Dec 03 2019, 4:00 PM)
4.[T][ ] review A | B \ notes
```

The shared farewell follows. Loading produces no additional console output.

## Test case 14: corrupted saved data is reported safely

Aim: Confirm that corrupted saved data does not crash MoistBot or partially
populate the task list, and that the user receives an actionable explanation
identifying the first invalid line.

Initial-file variants:

- Invalid completion flag: `T | maybe | read book`
- Unknown task type: `X | 0 | read book`
- Missing field: `D | 0 | return book`
- Invalid deadline date: `D | 0 | return book | Friday`
- Invalid event dates: `E | 0 | meeting | Tuesday | Wednesday`
- Backwards event range: `E | 0 | meeting | 2019-12-04 | 2019-12-03`
- Extra field: `T | 0 | read book | extra`
- Blank required field: `E | 0 | meeting | 2019-12-03 | `
- Blank line between otherwise valid records
- A valid first record followed by malformed line 2
- Invalid UTF-8 bytes

Inputs: `list`, `bye`

Expected output:

```text
My apologies, but line <number> in the save file is invalid. I have started with an empty task list instead. Please add your tasks again; MoistBot will replace the save file when the task list next changes.
Certainly. Here is your task list:
Your task list is presently empty. You may use: bye, list, todo, deadline, event, mark, unmark, or delete.
```

For invalid UTF-8, the unreadable-save-file message from test case 16 is
shown instead. In every variant, the list remains empty and the shared
farewell follows.

## Test case 15: missing save paths start safely

Aim: Confirm that MoistBot starts with an empty task list when either the
relative `data` folder or `data/moistbot.txt` does not yet exist.

Setup: Run once without the `data` folder, and once with an empty `data`
folder but no save file.

Inputs: `list`, `bye`

Expected output: The empty-list response from test case 2, followed by the
shared farewell. No storage error is shown.

## Test case 16: invalid save-file path is reported safely

Aim: Confirm that an unreadable save-file path does not crash MoistBot and
that a task addition is rolled back when it cannot be saved.

Setup: Create a directory at the relative `data/moistbot.txt` path.

Inputs: `todo buy milk`, `list`, `bye`

Expected output:

```text
My apologies, but I could not read your saved task list. Please check that the save file is readable, then restart MoistBot.
My apologies, but I could not save your task list. Please check that the data folder is writable, then try your command again.
```

No addition confirmation is shown. The following `list` response remains
empty, confirming that the unsaved task was rolled back, and MoistBot
continues to the shared farewell.

## Test case 17: dynamic task-list resizing

Aim: Confirm that the Java collection grows beyond the former 100-task array
limit and that the expanded list can still be saved.

Inputs: `todo task 1` through `todo task 101`, `list`, `bye`.

Expected output: All 101 additions succeed and report the updated count. The
final list contains tasks 1 through 101 with no capacity error.

## Test case 18: list deadlines and events by date

Aim: Confirm that `list <date>` displays only deadlines due and events starting
on or before the inclusive cutoff while retaining their original task numbers.

Inputs: Add one todo, deadlines before, on, and after 3 December 2019, and
events starting before, on, and after that date. Enter `list 3/12/2019`, then
`list 2019-11-30`, and `bye`.

Expected output:

```text
Certainly. Here are your deadlines and events on or before Dec 03 2019:
2.[D][ ] early deadline (by: Dec 01 2019)
3.[D][ ] cutoff deadline (by: Dec 03 2019, 6:00 PM)
5.[E][ ] ongoing event (from: Dec 02 2019 to: Dec 05 2019)
6.[E][ ] cutoff event (from: Dec 03 2019, 9:00 AM to: Dec 03 2019, 10:00 AM)
```

The todo and later dated tasks are omitted. The earlier cutoff produces:

```text
Certainly. Here are your deadlines and events on or before Nov 30 2019:
There are no deadlines or events on or before Nov 30 2019. Please enter another date or use 'list' to view all tasks.
```

## Test case 19: find tasks by description

Aim: Confirm that `find` lists todo, deadline, and event tasks whose
descriptions contain the case-sensitive search term, numbers only the matches,
and does not match date details.

Inputs: Add `read book`, `return book`, `book club`, and `buy milk`; mark the
first two tasks; then enter `find book`, `find Book`, `find 2019`, and `bye`.

Expected output for `find book`:

```text
Certainly. Here are the matching tasks in your list:
1.[T][X] read book
2.[D][X] return book (by: Jun 06 2019)
3.[E][ ] book club (from: Jun 07 2019 to: Jun 08 2019)
```

Both unmatched searches produce an actionable message such as:

```text
My apologies, but no task descriptions contain 'Book'. Please try another search term.
```

## Test case 20: find requires a search term

Aim: Confirm that a missing search term is corrected politely and does not end
the application.

Inputs: `find`, `bye`

Expected output:

```text
Please provide text to find. Usage: find <search term>, for example 'find book'.
```
